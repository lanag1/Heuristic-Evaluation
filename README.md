## About the project
#### As the we have moved through history, we can see the great strides our world is making in the technological realm. These advances have unfortunately left members of our society in the dark as they feel they do not have access to or knowledge about these technologies. The most impacted group being our parents and grandparents. This impacts many aspects of their lives as they do day to day tasks, such as making calls, setting appointments, etc. Below I will give a heuristic evaluation of some of these goverment web services specifically, the New York ID website and the New York Coronavirus website, to see how usable and accessible these sites are to the older generations.
## [Nielsen's 10 Heuristics Explained](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

### 1: Visibility of System Status 
Users know what their doing on a site as well as athe consquences and impact of their actions on the site.
### 2: Match Between System and Real World 
Design of the site should follow real world conventions, making information clearer for users.
### 3: User Control and Freedom
Users need a clear way to abandon actions that were made by mistake.
### 4: Consistency and Standards
Site should follow the same theme, layout, conventions, etc.
### 5: Error Prevention
Errors are often made when the site doesn't fit the user's mental model. In this case, users need to be presented with a confirmation option if they commit to an action.
### 6: Recognition Rather Than Recall
Have easily recognizable elements so users don't have to commit things about the interface to memory.
### 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
Allow actions to be completed in multiple ways so the site is accessible to all users.
### 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
Include only relevant content and features on a site so it is easy to navigate for users.
### 9: Help Users Recognize, Diadnose, and Recover From Errors
Tell users of the site why and error happened and provide suggestions on how to resolve the issue.
### 10: Help and Documentation
Give users a resource for extra help and assistamce.

#### Backrground Information: This site was set up to inform citizens of the rules and protocalls as well as genral info about getting a New York ID. This site proves to be useful as it also gives you access to many other government resources, such as unemployment benefits, Tax Services, the DMV, etc.
