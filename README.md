## About the project
#### As the we have moved through history, we can see the great strides our world is making in the technological realm. These advances have unfortunately left members of our society in the dark as they feel they do not have access to or knowledge about these technologies. The most impacted group being our parents and grandparents. This impacts many aspects of their lives as they do day to day tasks, such as making calls, setting appointments, etc. Below I will give a heuristic evaluation of some of these goverment web services specifically, the New York ID website and the New York Coronavirus website, to see how usable and accessible these sites are to the older generations.
## Site 1: https://my.ny.gov
#### Backrground Information: This site was set up to inform citizens of the rules and protocalls as well as genral info about getting a New York ID. This site proves to be useful as it also gives you access to many other government resources, such as unemployment benefits, Tax Services, the DMV, etc.
